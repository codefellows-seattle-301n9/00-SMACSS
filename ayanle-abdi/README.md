##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I followed the SMACSS guidelines to ensure that each CSS file has a purpose, i.e. layout vs base, etc.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I have not done any refactoring.
