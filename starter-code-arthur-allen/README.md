##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I read the descriptions in the other README file about where elements should go.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

Though the directions stated the puropse of a state.css file, the directions didn't specificlly tell me to create a state.css file.  When I saw an element that should go in a state, I created a file and linked to it in the HTML.
