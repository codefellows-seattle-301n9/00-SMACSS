##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I determined where the CSS rules should be placed based on how specific the selctors were and the intended effects of the CSS selectors. Fundamental elements went into the base file, while more specific elements and descendants that dealt with positioning on the page went into the layout file. The most specific style rules, along with classes and ids, were placed into the modules file.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, I did not refactor any of the existing CSS, just repositioned the CSS rules into their respective files based on SMACC guidelines.
