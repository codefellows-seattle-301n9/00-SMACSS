I determined which rules to used based on the function/purpose of the rules and if they readily matched the Base, Layout, Module, State or Theme rules of thumb

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not do any refactoring because as I worked the code and tested it...the functionality and look of the website did not break. If it isn't broke....
