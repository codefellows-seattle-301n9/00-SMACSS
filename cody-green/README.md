##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(i went through one by one and moved files to the place where i thought they should go basically with parents in layout and children in modules and the global ones in base.)

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(i did not i will try to see if i can play around with it a bit here tonight.)
