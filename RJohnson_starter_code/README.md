##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?
Reset.css should run first in the cascading order of the style pages.

Base.css should cover the basic html page content (*, header, head, body, footer) and items that are used universally across all pages.

Layout.css should incorporate content that affects the basic layout of the page.

Modules.css should cover all additional styling to the base and layout pages.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not refactor the existing css in the interest of time for this project but I did look over the existing code extensively and consider each component and to which category for which it was the best fit.
