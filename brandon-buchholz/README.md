##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(I put any tags that pertained to the main page and the reset into the base.css folder. I put any layout items like nav, footer, and aside items into the layout folder. And finally I put items that where smaller and not part of the other elements into the modules folder)

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(No I did not do any refactoring.)
