##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

For base, I put everything that was very basic that should be used across the site into this file.
For Layout, if it had to do with sections as in nav or side bar or main body, I put it into this file.
For modules, it it had to do with something specific like a Class or an ID I put it into this file.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I didn't do any refactoring, everything seemed to be laid out pretty well. If I was to do any refactoring, I would design for mobile first then expand.
